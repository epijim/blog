title: 'Leaving Ubuntu for Debian'

## Why I moved from Ubuntu to Debian

### Reasons

I like unity menu bar / title bar. Launcher is OK.

I hate unity dash, slowness of unity, why is it so slow and laggy even on an expensive ultrabook? xfce has compositor with transparency and such.

Unity is not Unix. Unity2D was.

Canonical - thankful - but why bzr, unity, mir, upstart

### Challanges

sudo

upstart

recent versions (xfce with dual monitor support, shotwell)

ubuntu one / ubuntu music

less beautiful installer, something with the efi...

debian testing

### Outcome

Much faster, much more stable and bug-free (e.g. keyboard layouts in xfce), much faster even on the command line
