## Coffee powered

Here's a little blog engine I hacked together just for the fun of it. I call it _colbo_.

### Features

It is fast, in-memory and does gzip and deflate. It can read markdown files.

Here's how you can use it.

    #!coffee
    Blog = require 'colbo'
    blog = new Blog dir: __dirname + '/articles'
    blog.on 'ready', -> blog.listen 3000

## And now?
