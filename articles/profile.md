## About me

Hi, I'm Philipp, CTO, lead developer and co-owner of UPcload, a Berlin based
startup that solves the fitting problem of online apparel shopping.
We've developed a technology that measures your body dimensions with a webcam
to provide a fit prediction for clothes.

### Computing

Check my <a

impresson of how I work.

Currently I'm mostly doing JavaScript development on both, the back-end and the
front-end.
