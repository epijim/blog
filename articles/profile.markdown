title: 'My Profile'


## My profile

I am Philipp, CTO, lead developer and co-owner of UPcload, a Berlin based startup that solves the fitting problem of online apparel shopping. We've developed a technology that measures your body dimensions with a webcam to provide a fit prediction for clothes.

### My computing

Here's what I currently enjoy working with: vim, tmux and zsh. Using these since late 2011!

At UPcload, I am pretty much into CoffeeScript and Node.js. It is fun and amazing, but some day, I'd like to get into Haskell.
