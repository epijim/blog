## About me

I am Philipp, CTO, lead developer and co-owner of UPcload, a Berlin based startup that solves the fitting problem of online apparel shopping. We've developed a technology that measures your body dimensions with a webcam to provide a fit prediction for clothes.

### Computing

Currently, I enjoy getting my stuff done with vim, tmux and zsh. Using these since early 2012! Check my <a href="http://github.com/strathausen/dotfiles">dotfiles at github</a>.

At UPcload, I am pretty much into CoffeeScript and Node.js. It is fun and amazing, but some day, I'd like to get my hands dirty with Haskell.
