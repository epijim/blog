## The 2D revolution: Home made 2D glasses

When going out with friends to see a film,
we're always arguing about whether we should see it in English or German,
or whether it should be in 3D or the traditional 2D one.

Now that I went with my wife and some friends to see
Star Trek Into Darkness in Berlin,
we found ourselves in a bizarre situation:
the film was only available in 3D except in one cinema,
where they show it in 2D but dubbed in German.

Around half of my friends don't like 3D,
but most of them prefer original versions over dubbed ones.

There is a solution: Home made 2D glasses!
One can now go to a film in 3D and pay the superiour 3D price,
but watch it secretly in 2D!
Or, one can go with their 3D hating friends to a 3D movie
and have them watch it in 2D.
