## Vimify

I am announcing my <a href="https://strathausen.github.com/vimify" title="Vimify on Github">latest code snippet</a> that uses vim to turn your source code into HTML and CSS, for your web project!

### The Idea

Vim has excellent highlighting support for a variety of programming languages, and probably one of the most complete in the universe. Why not use it in node? There are already <a href="" title="">tools taking advantage of this out there</a>.


### How It Works



### Usage

Convinced? 

1. Install it via npm, e.g.

    npm install vimify -S

2. Use it your code.

### Summary

Using vim as a highlighter is really awesome, and not quite without disadvantages.

- Vim generating HTML is damn slow (1-3s per code block)
- The generated HTML sucks! It's like from the nineties. And with line numbers 
- Vim's code highlighting for JavaScript sucks so much! (I never realized that)
- Why is vim so hard with stdin and stdout?

Vim is certainly a great IDE, but it's not yet ready to become a code highlighting generator engine. I'll probably switch to something else in the JS repositories. Probably. As soon as I have time for that...
