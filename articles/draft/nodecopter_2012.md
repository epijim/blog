## Nodecopter 2012

Recently, I've had the pleasure to participate in <a href="http://nodecopter.com">nodecopter</a>,
where hackers gathered in a pre-world-wars,
3 story abandoned bath house to hack flying robots with node.js all day long
while drinking beer and having a lot of fun.

### The venue

### The hacking

### The organisers

There I met <a href="http://npmjs.org/~bkw">Bernhard</a> whom I know from our cooperation with youtailor
and we hacked a quadrocopter that was following people's faces.
Due to just finishing seconds before the final demo and some wireless problems,
we had to demo the robot to the crowd completely untested.
And yet, it just worked!
From now on, I am going to never test anything before demos ever.
