## Vim highlighting your blog

Some weeks ago, I wrote a javascript module using vim to transform source
code into highlight HTML and CSS, after having stumbled upon vim2html.

### The implementation
### The pros

1. You get all kinds of languages highlighted for free - sure vim has a
higher coverage than your favourite highlighting library.
2. You get nice terminal colours and feel at home on your blog.

### The cons

1. Wow, vim's highlighting of JavaScript sucks! I never really noticed that.
2. It can be quite slow. Vimify takes up to a few seconds to
highlight one snippet of code. I should try cleaning up `.vimrc`.
3. The HTML output sucks.
4. I did not get vim to work
